    <h2>Why is a smart classroom important?</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 30px;">Students are sure to become interested when
         technology is incorporated into regular lessons. It makes education 
         fun and enjoyable. For example, a teacher can use an engaging video
          to explain photosynthesis with the aid of smart classroom technology.
        This approach promotes greater student involvement because smart 
        classrooms can make challenging or uninteresting subjects more engaging.
        Technology-integrated classrooms fascinate students and build their
         interest in studies. With the aid of improved learning techniques,
          they are intrigued by the subjects and comprehend them better.
           Individuals can retain the information for a longer period of time 
           when they grasp it better.
